The East Turkestan Republic (ETR) was a short-lived satellite state of the Soviet Union in northwest Xinjiang (East Turkestan), between November 12, 1944, and December 22, 1949.[11][12] To differentiate it from the First East Turkestan Republic (1933â€“1934) it is often described as the Second East Turkestan Republic, although the adjective Second was never an official part of its name.

It began with the Ili Rebellion, in three districts: Ili, Tarbaghatai and Altai, in Xinjiang Province, which was part of the Republic of China. Initially it was backed by the USSR. During 1946, the ETR participated in the Xinjiang Provincial Coalition Government, while maintaining its independence. In February 1947, the officials of the ETR withdrew from the Coalition and re-asserted their independence, arguing that all of Xinjiang should be liberated from Chinese rule. The rest of Xinjiang was under Kuomintang control.

In late 1949, most of its key leaders and officials died in the Soviet Union, while they were travelling to attend talks in Beijing. Before the end of 1950, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) had captured most of the area of the ETR, which ceased to function. The entire region became part of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Most of the area controlled by the ETR later fell under the jurisdiction of Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture.
